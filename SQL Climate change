Question 1: How many countries are represented in this dataset?
A: 
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT(country)) 
FROM 
  temperatures_by_country

Question 2: How many temperatures with a null value exist in this dataset?
what is the overall percentage of null temperatures?
A: 
SELECT
	COUNT(CASE WHEN avg_temp IS NULL   THEN 1 END) null_count,
	SUM(CASE WHEN avg_temp IS NULL  THEN 1 END)*1.0 / COUNT(dt) null_percentage
FROM 
  temperatures_by_country

Question 3: what is the earliest and latest year represented in this datasetï¼Ÿ
A: 
SELECT 
  min(dt), max(dt)
FROM 
  temperatures_by_country

Question 4: what are the top 10 countries with the highest average temperature?
A: 
SELECT 
  DISTINCT(country), 
  AVG(avg_temp)
FROM

GROUP BY 
  country
ORDER BY

Question 6:
STARTING FROM THE YEAR 2000, WHAT IS THE RELATIVE CHANGE IN OVERALL CLIMATE YEAR OVER 
YEAR IN FAHRENHEIT. RELATIVE CHANGE = ((X2-X1)/X1)

A: VERSION 1
with six as (

FROM six
GROUP BY YEAR


VERSION 2:
